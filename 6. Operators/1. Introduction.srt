Welcome back to Introduction to C++. My name is Kate Gregory and I'm introducing you to the most popular

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
general purpose programming language, C++. In this module you'll meet the rather amazing number of

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
operators that C++ has for performing arithmetic, comparing, and so on.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
There are some pitfalls waiting for you and I'll show you what often trips up beginners to C++.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
You'll also learn how your own classes can get in on the operator story by writing your own overloads of

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:59:00,000
common operators for your code.
