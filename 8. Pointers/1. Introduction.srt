Welcome back to Introduction to C++. My name is Kate Gregory and I'm introducing you to the most popular

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
general purpose programming language, C++. In this module it's time to finally tackle the most scary part of

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:25,000
C++, pointers. Now you've seen you can write useful and powerful C++ applications without pointers.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
We've written a lot of code and covered a lot of ground in a completely pointer-free way.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
In fact, if you have pointers or difficult stories from other people or memories of your own, you know

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
they're based on how C++ used to be written. That said, it is time to see what pointers are, what they're

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
for, how you can have long-lived objects in your applications, and why it's not as bad as people have told

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:59:00,000
you. This is also the place to discuss references and the const keyword, so let's get started.
