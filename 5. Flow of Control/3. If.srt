00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Let's begin with if. Like all keywords in C++, it's spelled all lowercase and the syntax is if round bracket,

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
some condition and round bracket what to do if that condition is true.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
The round brackets are not optional, if you leave them out you're going to get a syntax error.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Your condition could be something like x is &gt; than 0, y+2 is &gt; than some function or another, any expression you

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
like and you can test against things that are not Boolean values.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
You can test against numbers and it's quite common actually to see C++ people do that.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
When somebody tests against 7, or variables that are not Booleans, their converted to Booleans using the rules

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
we talked about before, 0 is false, everything else is true, going to the if or not.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So for example if x&gt;3, y=7. You can put a line break in there if you like, like this, they're both exactly the

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
same complier couldn't care less and it's important to note, compiler does not read indents and doesn't understand

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
anything special, based on whether or not you indent the lines, those are for humans.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So if you're going to have your action across multiple lines you have to enclose it in braces and I prefer to use

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,000
them even for a single line, like this. If x&gt;3 { y=7 }.

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The reason I prefer them is simple. When you go and add a second line, you can add it between the braces and

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
it'll still works. If you just add a second line when you didn't have any braces and you forget to add them, you get

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
weird bugs because nobody complains, but the second line gets executed every single time regardless of whether

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
the if is true or not. So as a best practice, always have braces even when there's only a single line in your action.

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Now you can have an else clause if you like, it just goes immediately after the if and if has all the same rules

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
about single line, multiple line with braces, best practices to have braces.

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You don't have to have an else if you don't want to.

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
If you have a lot of ifs and elses all kind of muddled up together, sometimes the complier can match ifs up with

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:59:00,000
the wrong else, braces can help there to make it really clear what your intent is.
