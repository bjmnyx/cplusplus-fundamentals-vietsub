00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Switch really solves only one problem, but it's a problem that happens a lot, it's a pattern that's super common

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
in your applications and that's when you basically have a whole pile of ifs because you're trying to figure out

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
which condition you're in. So affects is 1, do something or another affects is 2 do something or another, affects

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
3, do something else and it's a little inefficient to do it that way because the compiler would keep testing.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Once you know that x is 1 it can't possibly be 2 or 3, and yet you're testing your ifs over and over, so then people

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:45,000
write nested ifs. So they write if x is 1 do this else, brace bracket, if x is 2 do this else and you sort of

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
nest and nest and nest it, it gets really hard to read.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The switch statement is just a cleaner version that people can clearly follow.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Here's the syntax, other languages have this, but the exact word that's used varies from language to language.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Where the brackets and braces and what not also very vary, so we have round brackets around the expression, just

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:16,000
as with an if, just as with a while. Must have a and open brace immediately after that and a closed one, not optional

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:26,000
and then you have one or more case statements and each one of them is case value: what to do and then a break,

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
and optionally at the end of it all, you can have a default: and what to do.

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
If you leave the break off, control just falls down and executes the next case for you, which is sometimes what

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
you want, usually not what you want. Then you have a closed brace at the end of the whole thing to say okay, I'm

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,000
all done with the switching. You don't have to have a default, so it's not like the complier can say, I processed

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
the default, so I must be done, it needs that to let it know.

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You don't put brace brackets after each case because you keep going until you hit the break, so there's no need for

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
braces after each individual case statement. The expression you're switching on, needs to work out to an integer.

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's very common to switch on the value of a single variable, but it could be some expression or in a enum,

21
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,000
which are integers behind the scenes and the individual case statements you're testing against integer values

22
00:02:19,000 --> 00:59:00,000
also or enum values.
