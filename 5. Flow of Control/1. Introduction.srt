Welcome back to Introduction to C++. My name is Kate Gregory and I'm introducing you to the most popular general

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
purpose Programming Language C++. In this module, you'll really see how to build a program using loops,

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
conditionals, those other flow of control statements that essentially all programming languages have.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Some of the C++ ones aren't as well known as things that are common in other languages.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I have some lightning quick demos that don't really do anything useful, but they show how all these constructs work.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
This is also a good time to start to talk about functions, the real building blocks of just about every application.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:59:00,000
In C++ we have both free functions and member function, I'll show you them both and show you the difference.
