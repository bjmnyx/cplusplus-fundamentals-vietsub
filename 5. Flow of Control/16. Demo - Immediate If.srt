00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
A simple demo for an immediate if.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,000
To make it not entirely trivial, I also thought I'd show you another idiom for the let's keep going until someone

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:20,000
enters their signal value to quit. I showed you before with the switch, we first prompted the person, enter a

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
number, then we went into the loop, and then we did the prompting again at the bottom of the loop.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
The other possibility is to put the prompting in the loop, then you have to initialize the variable to what we

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
call a signal value. Something that will make sure you go into the loop.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So here, we're setting x=99 and then saying while &gt; 0, which of course it will be for sure the first time.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Then we can go through and process our number. There are some other ways to move the test to the end, but you'll

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
see this pattern fairly often and sometimes people are confused they're like you set it 99 and then you immediately

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
check whether it was &gt; 0, of course it's &gt; 0, yes, but you'll be guaranteed they'll be some code inside the loop

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
that will change it and that way you're going to go into that loop at least once, but you don't know how many times.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
That's the while part. Here's the immediate if part. Here's the ?.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
So we're declaring a string which we're calling sign and we're giving it the value all in this single line of code.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
We're saying, is x&gt;0? And you don't pronounce it, that's what the ? is supposed to help you do.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Is x&gt;0? If it is, sign will end up saying positive if it's not then sign will end up saying 0 or negative.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Then we're just going to print out your number is and that string variable sign.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Easy enough, let's run this one a couple times

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So if I say 55, you're number is positive. Excellent. -11, your number is 0 or negative and then it's done

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It's a very simple little thing. Mostly what it is, is people say what, where did this ? or why is there are :

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:59:00,000
in the middle of this statement, now you know that's an immediate if.
