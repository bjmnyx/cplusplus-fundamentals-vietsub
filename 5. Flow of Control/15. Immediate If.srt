I mentioned it's very non C++ to say if x = true return true else return false, you would just say return x

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and similarly, certain kinds of constructs around if's where all you're doing is setting the value of a single

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
variable, they set some C++ developers teeth on edge and they prefer to use an immediate if.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So this isn't wrong. If whatever result = 7 else result = 302, the complier will like it, it'll execute just fine

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:44,000
there's no speed hit from doing it, but many people prefer to use this notation, result = something?, that's how

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
you're supposed to pronounce it, 7 and then the : you can pronounce else 302.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
These mean exactly the same thing. If something evaluates to true, result will get set to 7.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:05,000
If something evaluates to false, result will get set to 302 and it just takes a single line instead of four lines

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
to get your expression across. There's not constraints on what you can put in there.

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
You could say 7, but you could also call something along function.

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You can say 302, but you could again call some big long function if calculations whatever you want.

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:30,000
As a best practice, it's more readable if at least one of them is just a simple literal, but you can use the same

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:59:00,000
kinds of things that you could use if you wrote it out the long way, it's simply a matter of syntax.
