Flow of Control is just about which lines in your program execute in what order.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Normally speaking, control flows from one line to the next, integer x = 2, x = 3, print something out showing the

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
value of x and they all just happen in that order, but just about every programming language has some way to

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
change that around and you should probably recognize things like if, and while, you can also call a function.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:36,000
They're pretty simple things to get, the trick maybe is the syntax and the C++ syntax I'll show you in working code,

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
so that you can see how it's done and remember as I like to say, the complier is your friend so that if you mess

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
up and leave off some brackets, you'll get an error message, then you'll know what to do about it.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Things that are a little difficult in C++, there are a for loop, not every language has a for loop.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The switch statement and the Immediate if. I also want to talk about the break, which is relevant in while and

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
for and a few other places and I'm just going to mention that goto exists.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I don't have a goto demo, I don't want you to use goto, it's there if you happen to read, is a goto, but all those

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
years ago we said goto is considered harmful and for those who aren't in on the joke consider harmful has really

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
become the nastiest insult you can give a language feature.

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not going to show you how to use it, I don't want you to use it, it does just for the sake of technical

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:59:00,000
accuracy, does exist, that's all I want to say about goto.
