00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
To get your own copy of Visual C++ Express, you can follow this

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:17,000
URL: www.microsoft.com/express/vc/ for Visual C++, and that will redirect you depending on your location to a

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:25,000
more complicated URL, which you can ignore, and you can see here the giant INSTALL NOW button for English,

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
or if you wish to install for a different language, you can choose it and click INSTALL NOW.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And there is a web based installer that runs relatively quickly, downloads about 70 MB,

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
starts to run and then installs Express on your machine.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And Visual C++ Express will coexist with Visual Studio 2010 if you have it installed as I do, but if you have

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Visual Studio 2010 installed, go right ahead and use that, you don't need to download Express,

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:59:00,000
just follow along with what we're doing.
