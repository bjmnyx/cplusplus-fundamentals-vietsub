1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Parts of this starter application were created by Visual Studio itself. I didn't have to type all of this in.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So, let me show you how to create a new application using Visual C++ Express.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
When you open visual C++ Express, most of the time it is going to look like this.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
This is called the Start Page. Now there may not be a start page when you open it if somebody unchecked this

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
box here that says, Show page on startup. If that's the case, you can always get it back on the view menu,

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
choose Start Page. In older versions of Visual Studio, a lot of people checked this box,

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Show page on startup, because the start page serves no purpose once you've started.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It just uses up a tab and gets in the way. That's why I love this tick, Close page after project load.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
This lets me have a startup page every time I launch Visual Studio,

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
but it doesn't bother me because as soon as I open an existing project, it goes away.

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And speaking of opening existing projects, here under Recent Projects, it lists out my recent projects.

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So the Hello project that I used in a previous demo is listed here, and it is a single click to open that up

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,000
and start working on it, but I want to show you how to make a new one. So I am going to click New Project.

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Because this is Visual C++ Express, it is only offering me C++ applications.

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
If you are using another version of Visual Studio, it may be offering you Visual Basic, or C# or any other

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
number of languages and that's fine. Make sure that you find the C++.

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And there are several different kinds of applications, and there are two different kinds with console

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
in their name, CLR Console Application and Win32 Console Application.

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And it's important not to get them confused.

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The CLR Console Application, has a rather unhelpful description.

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
A project for creating a console application, you are like woo-hoo that must be what I want right? No.

22
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
What you want is a Win32 Console Application.

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
The difference is that a CLR Console Application is that C++/CLI, it runs under the .NET framework.

24
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So yes it is a console application, but it is not just C++, it has those extensions in it to make it C++/CLI.

25
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It makes managed code, that's not what we are doing. So we want the Win32 Console Application.

26
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Win32 Project makes a Windows application. A Windows Forms Application makes a managed Windows application,

27
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
we definitely don't want those. Makefile Project is appropriate if you are coming over from another

28
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
compiler, probably from another platform and you want to use something called a makefile to control the way

29
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
your project builds. We are not going to go there. Empty Project is what is sounds like, you have to add things to it.

30
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
CLR Empty Project, same deal, but slightly different settings.

31
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And then finally Class Library, it mentions you can write libraries in C++ for reusable code

32
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
that's used by many other different applications.

33
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's a useful thing, but it is not what we are making today. So we want to use a Win32 Console Application.

34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And, you can give it whatever name you like, say FirstApp. And put it wherever you like.

35
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:30,000
By default, Visual Studio likes to put things in your documents under Visual Studio 2010 Projects.

36
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
And if that's where you are happy to have them, then that could be where they are.

37
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I have a different place for mine, it doesn't really matter. I am just going to click OK.

38
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:49,000
And in some languages, you make a new project, you get a new project, but in C++ you get a Wizard.

39
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It doesn't have very many steps. In fact, it really only has two steps

40
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
and the first one doesn't do anything, but you have a Wizard.

41
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
If without seeing the settings you are great because you just know what the settings are,

42
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:07,000
you could click Finish right now. Let's say we are not going to, let's click Next.

43
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Now you may have noticed a slight sort of change in the font situation on this side.

44
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It turns out, this is an index into the steps of the Wizard.

45
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
So if I click Previous, you can see one is a link and one is not.

46
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
And that's our two steps of our Wizard. So I could also get through it by clicking this,

47
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
or by using the Next and Previous.

48
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Now the questions that it's asking here, are questions it already knows the answers to.

49
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Do you want a Windows app, a console app, a DLL or a library? Well I already said I wanted a console app.

50
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Do you actually want nothing at all, you can take Empty project and you are probably thinking,

51
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
well if I wanted Empty project wouldn't I have chosen an Empty project?

52
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I know, I didn't write this Wizard, this is just what it is.

53
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
This pre-compiled header, I am going to suggest that you leave ticked,

54
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
even though you don't really know what it really means.

55
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It is something that makes your application compile faster.

56
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It doesn't make it run faster, but it can make it compile faster and it's therefore a good habit.

57
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You won't be able to take full advantage of it for a while yet,

58
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
but if you just get in the habit of leaving that ticked, it won't hurt you.

59
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
And then over here we have some things that are grayed out.

60
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And the reason they are grayed out is that this dialog is shared by different versions of Visual Studio

61
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:24,000
and in some of the other versions, you have options to add common header files for ATL and MFC.

62
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Express doesn't support ATL or MFC, so those options are grayed out.

63
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
So it turns out you really have nothing to do on this step of the Wizard, except click Finish,

64
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,000
but you need to look at it before you can do that.

65
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
So the Wizard runs and you can see that it generates some of the things that you saw in the sample app I showed you.

66
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
The comment, saying the name of the file, and Defines the entry point for the application,

67
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
the include of stdafx.h, and that's actually there because you ticked the pre-compile headers box,

68
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
the tmain, and the return 0. So you would put your own code in here to do whatever it is you wanted

69
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,000
your application to do. I haven't really talked about Solution Explorer up until now,

70
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,000
but this is a good time to explain a little bit. Solution Explorer is showing you all of the files in

71
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:18,000
your project and in your solution. The sort of unit of work in Visual Studio is a solution.

72
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,000
And a solution contains one or more projects, and a project is in a single language, it contains one or more

73
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,000
files, and you build a project at a time. If there are multiple projects in a solution, you can build them

74
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,000
independently, or build the whole solution at once. And one of the projects typically produces an executable

75
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:46,000
that you can actually run. So, when you right-click on the solution, one of your choices is to build the solution.

76
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:54,000
When you right-click on the project, you have a build that would just build the project, Project Only,

77
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Build Only FirstApp, and so on.

78
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Here we have only one project in our solution, so there is not much of a distinction between the whole

79
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
solution and the single project, but that's how it is organized in here.

80
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:14,000
And then you have your files and Solution Explorer categorizes your Header Files separately from your Source Files. It's just a convenience.

81
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
They are not actually arranged this way on your hard drive.

82
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,000
So, if I come up here to this tab, and one thing a lot of people don't know is that if you pause

83
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:31,000
it will tell you the path to the file. I can right-click the tab and chose Open Containing Folder.

84
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,000
And these are the actual files on my machine that have been created as part of creating this project.

85
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Now you will see that they are not split up into folders about headers and source and so on.

86
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
The .h files and .cpp files are all in here together.

87
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
That's just the way that Solution Explorer shows them to you.

88
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And to open any other file in the editor, you just double-click it over here in Solution Explorer.

89
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,000
This is ReadMe.txt, which explains what all the bits and pieces of the project are.

90
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:07,000
And this is that stdafx.h. Standard afx.h is your pre-compiled headers.

91
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Basically, things that you use a lot in many different places,

92
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
you can put in here and it will speed up the compilation process.

93
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
This poor little application doesn't use anything, never mind using something a lot in a lot of different files.

94
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:27,000
So we don't have anything extra in standard afx.h. Now that I have multiple files open in Visual Studio,

95
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
you can see how they each have their own document tab across the top.

96
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
You can switch between them just by clicking on the tabs, pretty straight forward.

97
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:45,000
And you can close any one of them just by clicking its X. It doesn't have to be open for you to close it that way.

98
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I hope this helps you to see how Visual C++ Express works and how to work with it.

99
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
The most important things you are going to do is typing code here in this editor, and running your

100
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
applications and looking at the output and learning from what you see in the output.

101
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,000
A little bit of moving around from file to file, and occasionally creating a new project, and you are ready

102
00:09:06,000 --> 00:59:00,000
to go in terms of using Visual C++ Express. Which means you are ready to go in terms of learning some syntax for C++.
