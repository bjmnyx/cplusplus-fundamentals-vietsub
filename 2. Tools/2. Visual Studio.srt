1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:10,000
In this course, I am going to teach you to how to write C++ applications using Visual Studio exclusively.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Visual Studio is what's called an Integrated Development Environment.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It has an editor where you can type your code, a compiler that transforms the code you typed into something

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
that can be executed, and a debugger that helps you observe it executing and learn where you may have a

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
problem and fix that problem, and a whole pile of other related tools as well.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Now, there are other ways to compile your applications, you can get standalone compilers, Microsoft has a

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
number of free ones that it distributes as part of its SDK, and other people

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
make and either give away or sell C++ compilers.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
But Visual Studio is more than just a compiler, and you won't be typing a lot of commands at the command line

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:59,000
and learning some strange syntax in order to pull your projects and applications together if you use Visual Studio.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Specifically, I am going to use Visual Studio Express, which is one of many different additions of Visual Studio.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Now Express is not a single thing, there is Visual C++ Express, Visual C# Express, and so on, as a version for

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Visual Basic for web development, for phone development and Express is completely and totally free.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It's free, even if you use it to make applications that you sell for money, that is all fine.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
There is a little functionality in some of the other additions of Vision Studio, that is not in Express.

16
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I won't be showing any of that functionality in this material, so to follow along in these demos

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
you can just get Express and use it.

18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And should the time come when you find, oh I do need something that's in Professional, which costs roughly

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
around $1,000, a little bit less maybe. And then maybe you discover, oh there is something that I need that's

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
in Premium, which costs about five times as much as professional or wow, I love this feature in Ultimate and

21
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I am willing to pay double what Premium costs to get Ultimate.

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
That's fine, that's your choice, but in order to follow along in this material,

23
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
you do not need to go out and get one of those versions of Visual Studio.

24
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Now if you happen to own a version of Visual Studio, perhaps because you work in another language and you are

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
considering adding C++ to your arsenal, you can of course follow along in all of the demos I am going to

26
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,000
show you, using your copy of Visual Studio. Things may look a little different, because Express is a simpler,

27
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:40,000
stripped down UI with less menus and less options, so my screens may look a little simpler than your screens,

28
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
but all the code that works in Express will work in other editions of Visual Studio.

29
00:02:45,000 --> 00:59:00,000
So that's not going to be a problem at all.
