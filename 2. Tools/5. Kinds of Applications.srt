C++ is a general purpose programming language. It can be used to write a wide variety of different applications.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So you could create a Windows application, that's something with, you know buttons and text boxes and drop downs,

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
the kinds of controls that you are maybe used to interacting with in a Windows application.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
It can also be used to write console applications, which is what I just showed you in the demonstration.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
They write text to the screen, they read text from the screen.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Interesting thing about a console application in contrast to a Windows application

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
is that they only sort of listen to you typing on the keyboard when they decide they want to.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So, it says enter your name and then it is sitting there listening and waiting for you to type your name.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
At other times you can type all you like and the application would not be listening and would not react to that.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Whereas in a Windows application, very often you can type anytime, anywhere without waiting to be prompted.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You can press F keys, you can click things with the mouse and the application is going to kind of react to that.

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You can also build in C++ services and servers, things that don't even have a user interface at all,

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
they just kind of run on the machine and they react to requests coming in,

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
typically from other applications or to things happening on the computer.

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
And you can write libraries, which is basically reusable code for other applications to leverage.

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The console applications are the simplest for us to deal with because there're really just working with text.

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Text to the screen, text from the keyboard. They don't have to show how to draw lines, circles, squares,

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
how to build controls, how to interact with Windows, how to react to being interrupted by user input at any time.

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
We can focus on just the syntax of the language. Where does the semi-colon go?

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
What is the name of this piece of the language and why does it look like that?

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Without having to learn how Windows works or the rules for how to draw really great three dimensional

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,000
graphics with a glow and transparency and so on. Those are the applications that we're going to be working with,

23
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
just as ways of demonstrating the language. Console applications are all about text and usually very

24
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:22,000
very simple calculations, so that you can focus on what you need to learn about syntax, punctuation,

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:59:00,000
and some of the other things that may be new to you.
