00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:09,000
This module has been about getting you ready to start to learn the building blocks of any C++ application.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So to start with, I would encourage you to go and get Visual C++ Express.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
If you have another version of Visual Studio, that's great, but Visual C++ Express is free and it will work

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
fine for all of the demos that we are doing. And its relatively a straight forward application to use and to

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
get comfortable and familiar with. Because it's an integrated development environment, you can edit your code.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
You can see those red wigglies when you make a mistake while you are editing your code.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
You can build as a combination of compiling and linking.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's not really terribly important at the moment to understand them.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
When you start to get errors, you need to be able to understand the difference between a compiler error

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
and a linker error and we will talk about those as we go.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And you see how to run an application without debugging or with debugging, and the possible problem

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
when you are running a console application, that if you run without debugging,

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
it just kind of runs out the end and you don't see the output.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And how running without debugging causes, Visual Studio will pause it for you, give you a chance to read the output.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
That's generally what we are going to want to do. Because console applications are the simplest,

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
that's what all the demos in this course are going to be, and that's what you are going to be using to get

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:59:00,000
comfortable and familiar with the syntax of the language and the way that applications come together.
