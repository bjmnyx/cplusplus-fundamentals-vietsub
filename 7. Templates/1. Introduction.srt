Welcome back to Introduction to C++. My name is Kate Gregory and I'm introducing you to the most popular

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
general purpose programming language, C++. In this module you'll learn about templates.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Templates in C++ are similar to generics in other languages, but different in some very important ways.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
When you first get started in C++ you can use templates right from the very beginning.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
In fact, sometimes you use them without even knowing it. It's less common to write them.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm going to show you how to write them, but just so we have some simple templates we can use in the demos.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Understanding how they work takes the magic factor out of using them and I want you to know what a powerful

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:59:00,000
technique templates are in C++.
