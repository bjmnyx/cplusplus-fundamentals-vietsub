00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Let's go back into this same project and add some code that copies some objects around so you can see some

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
slicing and some compiler error messages.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
In the interest of not watching me type, I'll just quickly paste this in.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Here I'm creating a local Person in local storage, passing the parameters into the constructor as always.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
This is fine. There's no problem with this line. On the next line I'm trying to create a Tweeter locally

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and initialize it by just copying that Person into it. And you see that the error here is, no suitable

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
user-defined conversion from Person to Tweeter exists. It can make a Person from a Person; it can make a

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Tweeter from a Tweeter, but in order to make a Tweeter from a Person I would have to write some code to

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
teach it how to do that because what are we going to use for the twitter handle?

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Let's come in at the other way then. Since that's not going to work let's make a local Tweeter (Typing) and

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:16,000
(Typing) make up a twitter handle, and again, apologies if that's anybody's real twitter handle,

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:30,000
and then let's make a Person (Typing) from that (Typing)

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:38,000
and then I'll use its GetName. (Typing)

14
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
What actually happens when this runs is that we copy the firstname, the lastname, and the arbitrarynumber

15
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:52,000
from localT2 into localP2 and throw away the twitterhandle, since we have no place to put it.

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:03,000
When we call GetName it calls the Person version of GetName. (Typing)

17
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Just says Local Tweeter. There is no handle

18
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:14,000
and that's because the handle is long gone. Now one way around this would be, I could've made this a Person

19
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:25,000
pointer; I could've asked for the address of local2; (Typing) and I could have switched from the dot

20
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:35,000
notation (Typing) to the arrow notation. That'll compile, but it's a lot of work, especially if I had more

21
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
than one line of code. Plus, that's a raw pointer. Maybe I should be using a shared_ptr.

22
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Here's a nicer way to get polymorphism while still keeping this syntax.

23
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I can make this a Person reference. One character I type. Run it.

24
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Now I get the Tweeter version of the function

25
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
even though I use the Person reference, and that's because references are polymorphic in the same way that

26
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:13,000
pointers are polymorphic. And I didn't have to go around with stars and ampersands and arrows and all of the

27
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
things that start to get people sort of punctuation-tense. It's okay.

28
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Just make it a Person reference. It's a polymorphic reference.

29
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It'll use the Tweeter GetName when I call the function.

30
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Same thing happens if you take a function that takes a Person by reference and you actually give

31
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
it a Tweeter, and then it happens to call some member functions of Tweeter.

32
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
That's what we'll run, Tweeter member functions, even though the code that's running thinks it's calling

33
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Person member functions. Course, they have to be functions that were defined in Person and furthermore,

34
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
were defined as virtual in Person, not just an extra thing like tweet that you added to Tweeter.

35
00:03:54,000 --> 00:59:00,000
It has to be something from Person like GetName, but then you will get the behavior you want.
