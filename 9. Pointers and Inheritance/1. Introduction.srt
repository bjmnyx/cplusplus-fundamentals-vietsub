Welcome back to Introduction to C++. My name is Kate Gregory and I'm introducing you to the most popular

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
general purpose programming language, C++. In this module I'll talk about polymorphism in C++.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Now, polymorphism doesn't sneak up on you. It can only happen when you have classes that inherit from

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
other classes and new pointers. It's actually an incredibly useful and productive technique.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
When you get to talk about polymorphism and pointers to objects and base classes and drive classes you have

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
other pieces of vocabulary like, virtual, slicing, casting. You know, to really get the C++ pointers story

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
you need to explore what happens with pointers to objects that are part of an inheritance hierarchy, so let's

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:59:00,000
do that.
