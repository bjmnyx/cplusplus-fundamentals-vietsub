Welcome back to Introduction to C++. My name is Kate Gregory and I'm introducing you to the most popular general

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
purpose programming language C++. In this module, I'll build on the concepts you met with fundamental types and

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:22,000
use them for user defined types, your own classes. So you'll see how to define and use objects that are instances

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
of class that you invented. That will need us to talk about some other concepts that are really important to

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:41,000
C++ like scope, the lifetime of an object, and we also need to discuss inheritance, namespaces, the C++ enum type,

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and the role of the preprocessor in a C++ application.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It's quite a lot of ground to cover, but at the end of it, you'll be really ready to work with objects with instances

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:59:00,000
of your own classes or classes from a library.
