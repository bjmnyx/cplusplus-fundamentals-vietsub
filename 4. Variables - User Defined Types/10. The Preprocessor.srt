00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:14,000
In all of the code you've seen so far, you've had some lines that start with this #, or hash, or pound symbol.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Most famously you've seen the include statement. This is a directive to the pre-processor.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It actually just combines the file in together. So when you say include Person.h, it picks a copy of all the

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
lines in Person.h and plunks them in right where that line appeared.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
People can do some very powerful and interesting things with pre-processor directives.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We've talked a couple times about I'm doing a debug, you could also do a release build and things are different

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
in a debug build then they are in a release build and you can actually use the pre-processor to make different

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
versions of functions for example, that have more output in them during a debug, and less output in for example

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:03,000
a release build. I don't want to go down the road of all the things you can do with the pre-processor, many

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
people try to use it as little as possible. They really just use it for includes, but there's one thing you

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
do need to be able to see when you see it in other peoples code and to be able to do it in your own and that's

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:23,000
the convenience of not having to memorize the structure of all of the headers that your system uses.

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:59:00,000
There's a concept known as include guards. This is easiest to see in a demo, so let's just get straight into it.
